dotfiles
========

Open Items
----------

* make config file for install script or at least a section where you can define
  a map from the filenames in ~/.dotfiles to the name of the symlink.
* make it possible to have OS specific config files (or possibly OS specific
  sections)

Ideas
-----

* have separate files such as bashrc.osx and bashrc.linux, and e.g. a
  bashrc.generic file which is sourced by the other files
